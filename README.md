# Currently, whilst shopping for clothing or accessories, people run into the issue of too many choices, many of which are not personalized to their preferences. Our product, Tailored, minimizes this indecisiveness when shopping. Acting as a blend of Google and Pinterest, Tailored will allow users to bring their fashion vision board to reality. The app will take in input information relating to their stylistic choices and demographics such as age, gender, preferred color palettes, textures, purpose of purchase, price range, gender, and urgency.
