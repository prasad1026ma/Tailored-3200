# Tailored
Currently, whilst shopping for clothing or accessories, people run into the issue of too many choices, many of which are not personalized to their preferences. Our product, Tailored, minimizes this indecisiveness when shopping. Acting as a blend of Google and Pinterest, Tailored will allow users to bring their fashion vision board to reality. The app will take in input information relating to their stylistic choices and demographics such as age, gender, preferred color palettes, textures, purpose of purchase, price range, gender, and urgency. From this user information, the app will select from multiple databases, the appropriate clothing options for the user, and display outfits with links to the specific pieces. This personalized method of shopping allows users to streamline their decisions.

The Database was created based on different user persons and then used to create a relational diagram with various entities and attributes. The schema is shown below to demonstrate the relationships:

The database was then populated with fake data created by mockaroo, which then became a functioning database, allowing one to pull data from it. From here, various API calls and structure were put into place to allow for data to be pulled and place into appsmith to be curated in a User_interfaced App. The app was then curated and established to ensure user accessability.
